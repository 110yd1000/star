# üìò Product Overview: Stardust Classifieds Platform

## ‚ùì Why This Project Exists

The rise of local and regional marketplaces has highlighted the need for customizable, self-hosted classified platforms that offer full control, scalability, and data sovereignty. Most existing solutions are either SaaS-based, limiting customization and control, or open-source but outdated or inflexible. **Stardust** exists to fill that gap.

## üöß Problems Being Solved

- **Lack of Control:** Existing platforms often restrict customization or are not tailored to local market needs.
- **Scattered User Experience:** Many solutions offer fragmented, non-intuitive interfaces.
- **No Admin Moderation Workflow:** Few free or open systems support structured ad approval processes.
- **Limited Search and Filtering:** Users struggle to find relevant ads due to poor filter/search capabilities.
- **Media Management Challenges:** Handling image uploads and storage is often cumbersome.

## üõ†Ô∏è How the Product Should Work

Stardust provides a seamless interface for users to:

- Register and log in using email or phone number
- Post and manage classified ads with images
- Browse ads by categories, location, and filters
- View, edit, or deactivate their own listings
- Interact via contact options (phone/email)

Admins can:

- Approve or reject ads before publication
- Manage users, categories, and subcategories
- Monitor platform activity through a moderation dashboard

## üéØ User Experience Goals

- **Simplicity:** Fast and intuitive ad posting process.
- **Responsiveness:** Mobile-friendly SPA interface with React.
- **Trust & Safety:** Ads are moderated; users are verified.
- **Speed:** Optimized filtering and pagination for quick access.
- **Clarity:** Clean, organized layout for both users and administrators.

The ultimate goal is to make Stardust a user-friendly, scalable platform for running local classifieds efficiently and professionally.
